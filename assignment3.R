# Question 1
# Correlation between age and endurance
cor(fit$age, fit$endurance)

# Question 2
# Unstandardized regression coefficient for age, predicting endurance
lm(fit$endurance ~ fit$age)
# Question 3
# Standardized regression coefficient for age, predicting endurance
lm(scale(fit$endurance) ~ scale(fit$age))
# Question 4
# Unstandardized regression coefficient for age, predicting endurance (while also using activeyears to predict endurance)
lm(fit$endurance ~ fit$age + fit$activeyears)
# Question 5
# Standardized regression coefficient for age, predicting endurance (while also using activeyears to predict endurance)
lm(scale(fit$endurance) ~ scale(fit$age) + scale(fit$activeyears))
